;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and doing
;; project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.
;;
;; Org mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that
;; contain information about projects as plain text.  Org mode is
;; implemented on top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep
;; the content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
;; structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily
;; created with a built-in table editor.  Org mode supports ToDo
;; items, deadlines, time stamps, and scheduling.  It dynamically
;; compiles entries into an agenda that utilizes and smoothly
;; integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.  Plain text
;; URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB
;; entries, and any files related to the projects.  For printing and
;; sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a structured ASCII
;; file, as HTML, or (todo and agenda items only) as an iCalendar
;; file.  It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked
;; webpages.
